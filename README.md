# Sports Roster



### A fun app you can use to manage a team sports roster, styled to look like retro 1970s-era Topps baseball cards, fully animated for you to virtually pick up and browse. You can add, edit and remove cards. They are saved to a firebase database and retreived based on your Google authentication info. 

## Install
This is a Javascript/React app. You'll first need to clone the repo to a local folder, then install packages and run the application with:

npm install
npm start
```
